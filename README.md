## StudentGo

A React Native application compatibile with iOS and Android presenting educational events obtained from Rithm Student Information System (SIS) API.

## Starting the applicaton

Ensure that you have all dependencies install after cloning:
`npm install`

To run the app:
`npx expo start`

Note that this application, as written, requires a local server of Rithm SIS to be running with sample data loaded into a local database.

Both development servers for front and back end must be running on the machine ip address - not 'localhost' as 'localhost' will issue the API calls to the mobile device, which will fail.
